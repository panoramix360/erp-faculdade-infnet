Infnet College Assignment - Requirements Analysis
====================

Objective:
We need to make a program that emulates a ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning), with various modules and implement some Design Patterns that are necessary.

Structure:
The project is structure in 3 Design Patterns:
- Command Pattern
- AbstractFactory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern

The application runs in a console and can be tested by everyone. We adopt this 3 design patterns to help our domain to work succint and solid.

The Command Pattern controls every menu of the application, and is a fast and elegant way to deal with user interface.
The AbstractFactory is used to instantiate, in runtime, the Managers that holds the data about the core objects of the application.
The Singleton Pattern is used to guarantee only one instance of the Managers, this implies that the Managers will exist in the entire application without loss of data.
